To control a user’s device you must deliver a signed, local helper (or browser extension) that the user installs, explicitly grant scoped permissions, then the cloud orchestrator issues signed commands over an encrypted channel; the UI must show live status, allow immediate revoke/kill, and agents speak via TTS/STT — all auditable and timeboxed.

1) High-level architecture (what to build)

Cloud Orchestrator

Plans tasks (LLM planner), policy engine, integrations, audit log, user account, UI.

Exposes secure command API to local helpers.

Local Device Helper (required) — must exist to perform real local actions.

Native app (Electron/Go/Swift/C#) + system adapters for keyboard, mouse, files, apps.

Or browser extension for web-only actions (forms, tabs).

Controls only within user-approved scopes.

Secure Channel

mTLS WebSocket / mutually authenticated channel between helper and orchestrator.

Voice Engine

STT (speech→text), TTS (text→speech) pipelines (cloud or local).

Low-latency streaming (WebRTC) for live two-way voice.

Frontend (Web UI)

Hiring flow, permission screens, “Your Hired Agents” dashboard, agent chat/voice UI.

Audit & Safety Layer

Immutable logs, screenshots (opt-in), action diffs, revoke & kill-switch controls.

2) User experience (exact flows & UI copy)
A. Hire flow (step-by-step)

User clicks “Hire Now” (sub-agent card)
→ open Login/Signup modal if not authenticated.

Post-login: Company details form (company name, domain, admin contact).

Permissions & Scope Screen (MANDATORY step). Show a clear list of requested capabilities with examples and toggles:

Example UI block:

[Agent: Customer Success Manager] requests:
• Access: Email (send/draft) — Example: "Draft & send follow-up to customer@acme.com"
• Access: Calendar (create/update) — Example: "Schedule follow-up call with client"
• Access: Browser control (open page, fill form) — Example: "Log into CRM and update ticket"
• Access: Files (read/write in /Replivo/*) — Example: "Attach invoice.pdf"
Choose autonomy level: [Suggest] [Confirm] [Autonomous (limited)]
[Run a safe demo action]  [Accept & Install Helper]


If Local Helper is not installed → present Installer flow:

“Download Replivo Helper” (signed installer).

Platform-specific instructions (macOS notarization, Windows UAC, Linux package).

Explicit permission prompts: show screenshots of expected OS permission dialogs.

Helper pairs with account using a one-time code or QR scan.

Test & Demo: run a harmless demo (open safe sandbox page) and show result.

Payment (if applicable) → final confirmation.

Agent is Added to “Your Hired Agents” and begins working according to autonomy settings.

B. Live controls & visibility

Agent card in dashboard shows status: Idle / Running / Needs Approval / Paused.

Live action feed: streaming text log + optional screenshots (if user opted in).

Voice UI: microphone button to talk to agent (push-to-talk); agent replies via TTS and shows text transcript.

Immediate Kill Switch: large red button in dashboard & system tray native to stop all agents immediately.

Permission panel: allow/revoke scopes per agent; timebox permissions (e.g., 2 hours).

3) Permission model & autonomy

Scopes: granular (email:send, calendar:create, browser:fill, files:read:path, system.input). Present human-readable examples.

Autonomy levels:

Suggest — agent proposes actions only (user clicks to execute).

Confirm — agent batches actions and requires one confirmation to run the batch.

Autonomous — agent can perform actions within scope; critical actions (payments, mass emails) always require confirmation.

Time-limited tokens: helper tokens expire automatically; user can set daily/weekly limits.

4) Local Helper – essentials & security

Why it’s mandatory: web apps can’t simulate presses, open desktop apps, operate local files reliably without a local component.

Implementation checklist (per OS):

macOS: notarized .pkg/.app; requests Accessibility and Screen Recording only as required; use AppleScript/AXUI for UI automation.

Windows: signed installer (.msi/.exe), UAC elevation where needed; use UIAutomation/PowerShell.

Linux: packaged snaps/debs; document desktop-environment-specific limits.

Browser Extension: Chrome/Edge/Firefox for DOM/form automation; uses native messaging to talk to the helper.

Security & hardening:

Code-signing, notarization (Apple), EV signing (Windows).

WebSocket with mutual TLS + client certs.

Command whitelisting (helper executes only signed command types).

Rate-limiting and per-session limits.

Local sandbox for file I/O; require ACL-style path selections (user selects folders).

Auto-updates with signature checks.

Privacy & audit:

Local logs of commands and returned artifacts stored encrypted; user may opt-in for upload to cloud for support.

All actions recorded in the orchestrator’s immutable audit log (hash + timestamp).

Option to capture screenshots only after explicit consent (and masked sensitive fields).

5) Command schema (example)

Use JSON envelopes; all commands must include request_id, agent_id, capability, args, policy:

{
  "request_id": "req-123",
  "agent_id": "growth.campaign_master",
  "capability": "browser.fill_and_submit",
  "args": {
    "url": "https://ads.example.com/campaign",
    "selectors": {"title":"#title","budget":"#budget"},
    "values": {"title":"Promo","budget":"500"}
  },
  "policy": {
    "autonomy":"confirm",
    "expiry":"2025-09-01T12:00:00Z"
  }
}


Responses include status, artifacts (screenshots, created IDs), logs.

6) Voice-first interaction

Goal: agent speaks primarily, with text transcript.

Components:

Microphone streaming (WebRTC) to cloud STT or local STT if privacy required.

LLM-based conversational engine on server to parse intent and produce actions.

TTS: cloud or local; stream audio back over WebRTC or play via local helper for low latency.

UX: push-to-talk or continuous with short wake-word (careful re: privacy). Show live transcript and “action preview” for confirm/autonomy modes.

Flow example:

User: “Hey Replivo, call the customer and confirm shipment.”

STT→LLM plans steps → shows plan in UI / reads it aloud: “I will call John at 2pm and send follow-up email. Confirm?”

User confirms by voice or click → orchestrator issues command to device helper / telephony adapter.

Recommended tech: WebRTC for low-latency audio; cloud STT/TTS (or local engines like VOSK/Larynx for privacy).

7) Integrations before full device control (safer MVP path)

You can achieve a lot without full desktop control initially:

OAuth API integrations: Gmail/Calendar/Drive, Slack, HubSpot — agents can do real work via APIs.

Browser extension for web-only automation (less invasive than full helper).

Simulated device commands in sandbox until consent + helper installed.

This path lets you test agent logic and voice UX before rolling local automation.

8) Safety, compliance & legal

Explicit consent recorded for every scope and stored (timestamped).

GDPR/CIPA/CCPA compliance where relevant; data minimization.

Terms & TOS plus an easily accessible “what we do” page listing actions agents may perform.

Insurance/indemnity and clear refund/dispute process for unwanted actions.

Make critical actions manual: payments, mass sends, financial transfers always require explicit confirmation.

9) Testing & rollout plan

Unit tests for orchestrator, command schemas, policy enforcement.

Staging with fake helper that simulates actions.

Beta with power-users: limited invite-only rollout; collect logs and consent feedback.

Security audit and penetration test.

Gradual rollout of helper capability sets (start with browser automation → files → keyboard/mouse).

Post-deploy monitoring: abnormal behavior alerts, rate-limits, automatic stop when anomalies detected.

10) Monitoring, recovery & support

Real-time monitoring for failed or suspicious actions.

Rollback: ability to revert actions where possible (e.g., delete scheduled events).

Support flow: agent report + user-initiated revoke + support ticket + audit trace.

11) Practical next steps (what to do now)

Decide MVP capabilities (I recommend start with OAuth integrations + browser extension + voice).

Write agent & sub-agent schema for the three mains (I can produce this JSON now).

Build the Cloud Orchestrator with:

LLM planner, policy engine, audit logging.

Mock executor for simulating actions.

Implement UI hiring flow with the exact permission screen copy (I can provide final wording).

Build a minimal Local Helper only when you’re ready to allow device control — start with signed browser extension and test flows.

Add voice stack (WebRTC + STT/TTS) for live conversation.

12) Sample permission screen copy (exact text you can use)

Replivo requests permission to help you automatically. Please review:
• Email (send/draft): Replivo will draft and send emails on your behalf. Example: “Send invoice to client@company.com
.”
• Calendar (create/update): Replivo can schedule and modify meetings. Example: “Book follow-up call at 10am.”
• Browser control (open pages, fill forms): Replivo can perform actions in browser tabs you approve.
• Files (read/write) only in folders you select.
Choose Autonomy: Suggest / Confirm / Autonomous (critical actions need approval)

Security & Ethical final note (must be included)

Because this gives software control over user devices and accounts, you must prioritize safety and transparency. No graduated access without user consent. Keep all logs and consent records. Add kill-switch and manual confirmation for dangerous actions.
