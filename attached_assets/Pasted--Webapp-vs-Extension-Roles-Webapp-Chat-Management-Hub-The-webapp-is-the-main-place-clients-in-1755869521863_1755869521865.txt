🔹 Webapp vs Extension Roles
Webapp = Chat & Management Hub

The webapp is the main place clients interact with their agents.

Features:

Real-time chat (text + optional voice).

Hire/fire agents.

Task configuration (standing instructions).

Dashboard showing all agent activities & reports.

Notifications for approvals.

Extension = Silent Execution Layer

Runs in the background, connected to the user’s browser.

Executes actions like:

Responding to emails.

Scheduling meetings.

Scraping data, posting to social media, etc.

Sends results + status back to the webapp dashboard.

🔹 Client Dashboard After Hiring

When a client hires their first agent, the dashboard becomes their “Control Room”.

1. Main Dashboard Layout

Top bar: Quick view → Total hired agents, pending approvals, active tasks.

Left side menu:

My Agents (list of hired main + sub agents).

Notifications / Approvals.

Task History.

Settings / Permissions.

Main panel:

Live Feed (timeline of what each agent is doing in real-time).

Task Log Cards (completed tasks, results, timestamps).

Agent Reports (weekly/monthly performance).

2. Live Notifications

Every action the agent takes appears inline in the dashboard feed, e.g.:

📧 Customer Support Agent replied to John Doe’s email.
⏰ Operations Agent scheduled a delivery for 2PM tomorrow.

Sensitive tasks automatically trigger an approval request popup:

⚠️ Marketing Agent wants to spend $100 on a Facebook ad. Approve / Deny?

3. Agent Communication

Agents speak in first person to feel human-like:

“I’ve just updated the client database. Do you want me to export a report?”

Client can respond in chat or voice.

Each message/task gets logged in the history tab.

4. Permissions & Security

On first hire → client grants device/browser permissions (email, calendar, drive, social accounts).

For every sensitive or financial task → agent asks permission before acting.

Permissions can be set as:

🔘 Always Ask

🔘 Auto-Approve under $X

🔘 Full Autonomy

5. Reports & Metrics

Weekly and monthly updates from each agent.

Example:

Customer Agent: 142 tickets resolved (+12% from last week).

Sales Agent: Added 53 new leads, closed 4 deals.

Presented in visual charts + agent chat summary.

🔹 Example Flow (with Dashboard in Action)

Client hires Sales Agent.

Dashboard shows new card: “Sales Agent — Active.”

In live feed:

“I drafted an intro email for 20 new leads. Ready to send — approve?”

Client clicks Approve → agent sends via extension.

Next day, dashboard shows:

“18 leads opened, 3 replied. I scheduled 2 calls for you.”

Client always sees a complete log of everything done + pending approvals.

✅ In short:

Webapp = brain + voice (chat, dashboard, reports, approvals).

Extension = hands (does the background execution).

Dashboard = control panel (full visibility, live feed, agent reports, approvals).
