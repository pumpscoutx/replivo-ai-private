You said:
list where all the buttons take when clicked to explain it to cursor ai
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely! Here's a clear mapping of all buttons and where they should navigate, so you can give it directly to Cursor AI for implementation:

Button Navigation Mapping – Replivo
1. Main Agents Page
Button / Click Area	Destination / Action
“Hire Now” (bottom-left of card)	Opens hiring workflow for that main agent, granting permissions for the agent to perform tasks.
Hover on card	Shows how the agent works (no navigation, just info tooltip/overlay).
“Didn’t find the agent you need?” link	Opens Custom Agent Requestor / Plugin Builder.
2. Sub-Agent Marketplace
Button / Click Area	Destination / Action
Sub-Agent “Hire” button	Opens hiring workflow for that sub-agent.
Compare / Side-by-side view	Opens a comparison modal showing features of selected sub-agents.
3. Agent Recommender Chatbot
Button / Click Area	Destination / Action
Suggested agent selection	Navigates to selected main agent card or sub-agent marketplace.
Request new agent	Opens Custom Agent Requestor / Plugin Builder.
4. Custom Agent Requestor / Plugin Builder
Button / Click Area	Destination / Action
Submit Request	Sends custom agent request to system; optionally triggers pooled request logic.
Select template / trending agent	Opens pre-filled agent creation flow for that template.
Back / Cancel	Returns user to main agents page.
5. Engagement & Reports
Button / Click Area	Destination / Action
View Monthly Report	Opens a detailed agent activity report for that user.
Gamified tracker link	Opens agent adoption/progress tracker dashboard.
6. Navigation / Global
Button / Click Area	Destination / Action
Header logo click	Returns to main agents page.
Profile / Account button	Opens user settings / subscription management.

This table maps every actionable button or clickable element to its intended destination, making it clear for Cursor AI to implement proper navigation throughout the platform.

If you want, I can combine this navigation map with the full platform prompt so Cursor AI gets both design and functionality instructions in one complete package.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
you should give me the links for the image and pictures instead of recommending the sites. the fonts and the design shouldnot look normal, just little bit different and advanced looking site.
ChatGPT said:

Here are four striking, abstract background visuals that would fit perfectly as high-end, visually engaging hero or section backgrounds for your Replivo platform:

A dynamic gradient wave with vibrant light flows—perfect for a hero banner.

A modern abstract gradient circle layout that brings depth and focus.

A mesh blur backdrop, offering a sleek and futuristic digital feel.

A futuristic network grid—tech-savvy and polished with glowing nodes.

Top-Notch Fonts for an Advanced, Modern Look

To make your front page typography stand out, here are some distinctive, expressive fonts with depth and uniqueness:

Proxima Nova – A sleek, geometric sans-serif that’s both modern and highly versatile 
Inviline
.

Poppins – Geometric sans-serif with round, approachable letterforms—versatile and bold 
Inviline
.

Inter – Designed for digital clarity; clean, high-legibility and perfect for modern SaaS interfaces 
landingpageflow.com
.

Space Grotesk – A contemporary, slightly techy sans-serif with bold character—ideal for stand-out headlines 
landingpageflow.com
.

Saira – Futuristic and minimal, blending readability with a polished, forward-looking aesthetic 
wix.com
.

Teko – Tall, narrow, bold—communicates impact in a compact space 
wix.com
.

Why These Work Well for Replivo
Element	Recommendation	Effect
Backgrounds	Use images like those above for hero sections or section backgrounds	Adds depth, polish, and modern flair—parallel to platforms like Beam.ai and Botpress
Fonts	Choose an expressive headline font (e.g., Space Grotesk, Saira) paired with a clean UI font (e.g., Inter or Poppins)	Creates visual impact while maintaining readability and sophistication
Layout & UX	Pair bold, unique typography with minimalist UI elements and subtle animations	Ensures the overall feel is high-end and distinct, not generic

Would you like me to craft a short Cursor AI prompt specifying which background and font assets to use? I can also include downloadable asset links or font file references if needed.

You said:
you have to write the links not the images i need at least ten more image links for my background, they must be my project related
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely—you want real image links, not just site suggestions. Here are ten high-quality background image links with a modern, tech-savvy feel, perfect for Replivo’s elegant and human-designed UI:

Why These Work for Replivo

Abstract, modern, and tech-inspired, fitting the intelligent, polished brand you’re building.

Varied styles—from subtle gridded textures to vibrant gradients—allow flexibility across different sections.

Capture that premium, human-designed aesthetic, avoiding anything too literal or “AI-generated” feeling.

Let me know if you'd like me to craft a Cursor AI prompt instructing where to use each of these images (e.g., hero banner, section backgrounds) or help style fonts to match the aesthetic even better!
